* Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

The HTTP module in Node.js is a core module that you use to build web servers and handle HTTP requests and responses.

To include a module, use the require() function with the name of the module:

var http = require('http');

** Node.js as a Web Server
The HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.

Use the createServer() method to create an HTTP server in demoHttp.js.
